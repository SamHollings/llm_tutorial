    "# LLM RAG Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will give you a simple introduction to how to get started with an LLM to make a simple RAG app.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows us to give foundational models local context, without doing expensive fine-tuning and can be done even normal everyday machines like your laptop.\n",
    "The basic idea is that we store documents as vectors in a database. When the user asks a question to the LLM, we can use langchain to first pass that question to the vector database, which retrieves relevant documents (these can be broken up into chunks, given metadata, summarised and various other steps to improve retrieval). The original question and these documents are then passed to the LLM (e.g. Claude) which then gives back the answer. So, in effect the model seems like it knows about what was in the database, e.g. local knowledge about your business, or hobby or whatever, whe in reality, that information was just injected into the prompt just prior to the model seeing it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main libraries we will use are:\n",
    "- Langchain: which is basically a wrapper around the various LLMs and other tools to make it more consistent (so you can swap say.. OpenAI for Anthropic, easily)\n",
    "- Anthropic: which is the library through which we will access the Claude model (more on why this is chosen below)\n",
    "- ChromaDB: this is a simple vector database, which is a key part of the RAG model.\n",
    "- sentence-transformer: this is an open-source model for embedding text\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the above are \"the best\" tools - they're just examples, and you may whish to use difference embedding models, LLMs, vector databases, etc."

    "## Setup\n",
    "- **Add documents to docs folder**: First there is a bit of setup. In this tutorial we won't go through how to take arbitrary sources and turn them into text files - that can be covered elsewhere. Instead, simply place some plain text documents ending in \".txt\" in the \"docs\" folder.\n",
    "    - There is a flat text version of the [Goldacre review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis) already there to get you started\n",
    "- **.env** file: to use the anthropic Claude model you'll need an access token. That can be made here: https://console.anthropic.com. After this you need to copy the env_example file, rename it \".env\" and add in your access token."

These concerns are legitimate, and must never be dismissed. Managing a health service effectively, or delivering high quality research at national scale, requires that analysts have access to the most detailed information, in the GP records of every individual in the country, to do their good work; but this also means a growing group of trusted analysts having access to every recorded detail, of every medical event, for almost every citizen, all the way back to birth.

Sometimes there may also be audits of how the data is stored and used, but with variable detail and aspiration.

It can also be extremely slow and frustrating to navigate as a data user: the team received multiple complaints of processes taking years to complete, being opaque, and appearing to end-users to be arbitrary in places. The principal security shortcoming of this method is that it relies on assumed trust: when large volumes of data are transferred, it moves out of the direct control and oversight of the NHS, and it becomes substantially harder – if not impossible – to confidently and comprehensively track what is done with the data, or ensure that it is not misused. Here, misuse entails 2 distinct categories: gross misuse, such as re-identification of individuals; and the likely more commonplace phenomenon of people running analyses on NHS patients’ data for which they do not have permission.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Analyses without permission\\nDuring the review the team was told repeatedly that ‘quickly’ running an analysis outside of the user’s current permissions is commonplace, when they have a downloaded copy of a large volume of NHS patient data: it is likely that this is the most common form of data misuse, and likely a lower risk category than many others. Two main categories of unpermitted analysis were alluded to: each is a reaction to restrictions in the current technical and administrative frameworks; each presents different risks.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='The first category was analyses conducted outside of the user’s permissions, but on data the user already held: for example, a researcher might conduct an analysis on detailed GP data to evaluate the feasibility of a new research project, or to see the likely answer from a full analysis, prior to going through the workload of a formal application to conduct the project. While this is low risk for disclosure, it does illustrate the lack of controls under the current model of ‘data dissemination’; it may result in ‘publication bias’ whereby salient negative findings are less likely to be published; it may compromise income to the NHS or other data services operating a ‘fee per project’ model; and it may reflect the risk of unethical research being conducted without permission ‘under the radar’.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='The second category was analyses conducted outside of the approved platforms.

Typically, this was justified on the basis that their local IT team imposed constraints that the analyst regarded as unreasonable or irrational, such as preventing the use of a standard modern data science tool that they viewed as secure. The fact that it is readily achievable to move large amounts of individual level data from one machine to another without detection demonstrates the extent to which data movements cannot always be readily controlled once they leave a TRE.

This means that teams managing data access requests in organisations such as NHS Digital and elsewhere are commonly applying rules of thumb, or intuition, to inform their proportionate responses.

Today, an unremarkable home computer can have the power to store and analyse vast amounts of patient data.

In broad terms, before expanding into the details, it is useful to draw an early distinction between 2 distinct concepts.

The letter to GPs from DHSC in August 2021 – announcing that NHS GP data would only be accessible in a TRE – stated that this TRE work would build on best practice in existing services such as the ONS TRE and OpenSAFELY. A summary of these 2 TREs is given below: historically ONS SRS has focused on the service wrapper, and OpenSAFELY on the software layer.\\n\\nONS Secure Research Service (SRS)\\nONS is a non-ministerial government department responsible with a range of responsibilities and statutory duties including: collecting and managing a range of person-level datasets including the census, death certificates, and various intermittent population surveys; and producing a range of official statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local level.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='ONS has run the SRS for approximately 20 years as the sole mechanism by which external users can access potentially disclosive pseudonymised person-level data from their own datasets.

This is a convenient way of working for many analysts, and requires almost no new skills, as it is familiar from the old way of working with downloaded datasets on the user’s own machine. It is important that this approach continues to be available, to meet the needs of users who do not have the aptitude or requirement to develop new skills; but it is also important to recognise and mitigate the problems it can cause around privacy, transparency, and open working.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='For example, it is hard for a remote desktop environment to detect misuse: more specifically, it is hard to keep and share informative activity logs as the user is in an environment where they can use tools interactively through a graphic user interface. At most, logs can be kept of keystrokes and mouse movements (a little like trying to store information about a ballet through the footprints left on the stage) or a video of the screen: these are only amenable to slow manual review. It is also harder to prevent data being misused: for example, all the data is readily viewable in an interactive data analysis tool. Because of these shortcomings, additional safeguards are often put in place for remote desktop services.

It is also much more straightforward to keep informative logs, share activity logs, and implement a range of security provisions that protect patient privacy by preventing or detecting misuse. Where there are additional privacy provisions, a full TRE can justify deeper access to more detailed and complete data while still maintaining the trust of professionals, the public, and patients.

There is room to improve the design of the regulatory system, in particular around duplication of effort: for example, there should be a de-duplication of application forms; and applicants should be present at decision-making meetings to address factual misunderstandings. However, this alone will not address the fundamental challenges; nor will a simple liberalisation of the rules, not least because there is substantial flexibility in the rules already, which are then interpreted cautiously by a range of actors in a range of roles across a range of organisations.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='This culture of caution is driven by a range of factors. Firstly, there is an incorrect belief that patients are against data-sharing.

Lastly, the needless current reliance by the NHS on less secure methods for data access (principally, disseminating large volumes of pseudonymised but re-identifiable data to multiple destinations) means that each decision to grant access requires a very deep trust in all aspects of every individual analyst or organisation involved.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Using secure platforms and transparency to earn public trust\\nConfidence from all can be increased by building and using TREs, where there are technical barriers to misuse; where all uses are monitored to ensure all activity remains with the permissions granted; and where all uses are automatically disclosed to earn public trust though transparency and accountability.

This variable must be created by someone, somewhere, running analysis code across the raw records. For example, code may be written to check in each patient’s record for the presence of any diagnostic code associated with hypertension.

There are many ways to record a diagnosis of hypertension in a patient’s record. This is partly because there are many different varieties of hypertension (and partly because of other complexities and necessities around creating a versatile global approach to clinical coding). There are over 300,000 SNOMED-CT concept codes in total, across all concepts in medicine (these can then be combined into new codes, just as the German language can combine single words to make new and longer ones).

Furthermore, not all hypertension codes will necessarily include the word hypertension. For example, ‘arteriolar nephritis’ is in the list of hypertension codes above, with good reason: it is a form of progressive kidney damage caused by long-standing, poorly controlled high blood pressure.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Creating these lists is therefore complex and difficult work. To do it, the team need a number of skills which may not all be embodied in one individual.

Canonical codelists have a role, but only for certain specific tasks, as discussed below.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='This complexity also means that codelists are often imperfect, for good reasons: it is therefore very problematic that codelists are often not widely shared between individuals and organisations, either because analysts and academics don’t think to share them, or sometimes because analysts specifically want to retain a competitive advantage over other teams, by having a good set of existing codelists to work with. Indeed, many publicly funded codelists, created by publicly funded organisations, are kept actively secret, withheld from the wider community, because the group that created them has the intention and the intellectual property rights to monetise them. The problems caused by these closed practices (and the wide system benefits of ‘buy out’ models when the NHS pays for this kind of curation work to be done) have already been discussed in the chapter on Open Working Methods.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Then there is a deeper problem: many patients with hypertension don’t have a diagnostic code recorded at all; but they do have multiple measurements of their blood pressure, where it is recorded as being systolic >140mmHg (which is high); or they are on lots of blood pressure medications. So now the person creating the variable for their analysis will need to come up with some rules, to create a ‘hypertension’ variable, that rely on treatment codes, or measurement codes, with logic like ‘if this valuable is higher than 140mmHg’. And they will need to do this for every diagnosis, or patient feature, that they are interested in.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Setting aside the complexity of making good codelists, there are then further problems.

That might depend on whether they have been receiving any treatments subsequently; or it might depend on what kind of analysis is being conducted today; and so on. To work around this, the analyst doing the curation would need to write some very complex logic: a patient might be denoted as having hypertension ‘IF these diagnostic codes are present between 2015 and 2020; OR IF these diagnostic codes are present between 2000 and 2015 AND these treatment codes are present more than N times’, and so on.', metadata={'file_path': 'docs\\\\goldacre_review.txt'}), Document(page_content='Then, where there are ambiguities, or edge cases, it might be useful to validate the variable created against another source.
