        "# How to use the Llama2 model with Langchain to make a proof reader\n",
        "### Author: Adam Hollings\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will show you how to use the LLama2 model, developed by Meta, with Langchain using the HuggingFace Transformers library.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why should I use Llama2 instead of OpenAI?\n",
        "Other tutorials use API keys to access other models, such openAI GPT or Anthropic Claude. LLama2 is hosted locally on the machine of your choice such as Google Colab meaning it doesn't need an internet connection (assuming you have downloaded the model file). There are various sizes and types of LLama2 model files, but for this tutorial we will use the smallest chat variant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bear in mind that the limitations of the compute available become a real concern; larger model files will require 15GB or more of free RAM to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "## After this tutorial?\n",
        "You could consider adapting the tutorials done on [LLM RAG](https://github.com/SamHollings/llm_tutorial/blob/main/llm_tutorial_rag_sources.ipynb) to use LLama2 instead of an API key model, by replacing the ChatAnthropic() agent with the HuggingFacePipeline() agent plus the code for the pipeline,\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "Nothing! This tutorial can run without any setup.\n",
        "\n",
